# ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nagasatwik145/Lord.git

cd Lord

npm install

npm run dev

# 🔐 Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and fill in your values. **Never commit `.env`** — it is git-ignored.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ | Client | Supabase project URL (public) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | ✅ | Client | Supabase anon/publishable key (public) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ | Server | Supabase project URL (server) |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | ✅ | Server | Supabase anon/publishable key (server) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ✅ | Server | OpenRouter API key for AI (secret) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ⬜ | Server | Admin client (bypasses RLS) |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | ⬜ | Both | Supabase CLI / tooling |
| `OPENROUTER_REFERER` / `OPENROUTER_TITLE` | ⬜ | Server | OpenRouter attribution headers |

> Only `VITE_`-prefixed variables reach the browser. Keep `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and
> service-role keys server-side only.

# 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

LORD AI is a [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) app. The build uses the Nitro
`vercel` preset, which emits a Vercel **Build Output API** (`.vercel/output`) with a
Node.js serverless function (SSR + `/api/chat`) and static assets.

1. Push this repository to GitHub and import it in Vercel.
2. Vercel auto-detects the build (`npm run build`). No framework override is needed
   (`vercel.json` disables framework auto-detection so the Nitro output is used).
3. Add the environment variables above in **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**.
   At minimum set the four Supabase vars and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
4. Deploy. The Node function runs on the same runtime the build targets
   (see `.nvmrc`).

Local production preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

# 🛡 Philosophy

LORD is built around a simple idea:

> AI should feel less like a chatbot and more like an intelligent Next-Gen AI for personal use only.

Instead of answering isolated questions, LORD aims to become a persistent, context-aware digital companion capable of assisting across projects, learning, productivity, and research.
